# dissertation_results
This is a repository of results from my dissertation research.

These results pertain to the eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities that are presented in Chapter 5 of my dissertation which is titled "Linearized Dynamics of Asymmetric Aircraft."

The results are organized by the traditional dynamic modes according to the labels

LP - Long-period mode, 
SP - Short-period mode, 
DR - Dutch-roll mode,
RL - Roll mode,
SR - Spiral mode,

the bank angle, either phi_0 or phi_45, and the derivatives or inertia components that are varied.

The different colors in the eigenvalue root-locus plots represent the sign (+ or -) of the unperturbed reference derivatives. Blue represents a positive reference derivative and red represents a negative reference derivative.

PDF versions of each figure are provided, as well as lower quality PNGs. Please contact me at troy.abraham@usu.edu if you have any questions.
